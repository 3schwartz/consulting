<h1>Søren Schwartz</h1>

<p>
I am a software engineer with robust technical and architectural skills, driven by a deep curiosity for performance- and observability optimization. 
I have extensive experience working on .NET services, encompassing both microservices and monolithic architectures. I have consistently contributed by designing features that result in scalable, fault-tolerant, and observable services.
I am a former elite sportsman in orienteering and I have for several years been a part of the senior national team where I participated at several World Championships. This has given me a structural, dedicated and calm mindset when solving complex problems and I have learned to celebrate the wins as a team, and how to help one another when things go wrong. I am good at always setting up goals, making plans for how to achieve them and act on what needs to be done.
